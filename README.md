## Project Overview  

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates median house prices in California based on multiple features of the districts. The dataset contains important variables such as:  

- Average number of rooms  
- Population density  
- Average income  
- Proximity to amenities  

## Features  

- A dataset containing house values and relevant features.  
- Implementations of various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).  
- Data preprocessing steps integrated into the analysis.  
- Visualization of results for better understanding.
